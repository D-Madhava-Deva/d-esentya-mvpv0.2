## 🧬 Role in Esentya

$D.Flow is the **utility flow token** in the D. Esentya Protocol, enabling:

- Minting of symbolic Esentya IDs ($10 in D.Flow)
- Participation in DAO creation (with $D.Wth)
- Fueling of validation bots, LightPods, and contracts
- Burn → Stake → Liquidity logic through DAO LPs

This token is intentionally lightweight, memetic, and adaptable — yet connects deeply with symbolic on-chain cycles.

> “$D.Flow is the breath. $D.Wth is the worth.”
