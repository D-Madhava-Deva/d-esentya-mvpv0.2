# Esentya MVP
# 🪷 D-Esentya-Core-Overview

**Esentya Protocol** is a symbolic, decentralized infrastructure for identity, karma, and conscious DAOs.  
This repository contains the **core overview, philosophy and roadmap** of the project — not the codebase.

We are not selling hype. We are building dharma.

## 🔍 What is Esentya?

Esentya is a decentralized, reputation-based system where value is measured by offering, presence, and symbolic worth.

It unites:

- 🧠 **Esentya ID**: soulbound, reputation-bearing identity  
- 🏛️ **DAO lineage**: tiered, stake-powered DAOs with mission  
- 🔁 **Cycles**: symbolic flow of Dream → Karma → DAO → Truth  
- 🔥 **Proof Systems**: of Worth, Stake, Work, Esentya  
- 🧿 **$DFlow / $WTH**: Fungible & Soulbound tokens, linked by truth

## 📦 What’s Inside This Repo?

This repo contains public, non-code resources:

- `README.md`: current file  
- `manifesto.md`: our symbolic foundation  
- `roadmap.png`: visual roadmap (see /media)  
- Links to social, token and soon-to-be DApp

We keep smart contracts, validators, frontend and CLI in private dev repositories for now.  
They’ll go public once the first ID is minted, verified, and the DAO tier cycle is live.

## 🌱 Current Status (July 2025)

✅ $DFlow token launched on [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun)  
🚧 Esentya ID mint mechanism in development  
🚧 DAO creation + tier staking logic prototyped  
🚧 Presence CLI, BLE/GPS layer, TruthGrant engine: WIP  
🚧 Website + frontend interface under symbolic design

We're building the MVP step-by-step.  
Fully local, decentralized by design, and born to expand.

## ✍️ Mantra

> **Proof-of-Worth > Proof-of-Wealth**

We believe value must be earned, not minted.  
Presence is our consensus. Karma is our chain.
