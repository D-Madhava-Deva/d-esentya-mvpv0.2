# 🏛 DAO-TIERS.md — D. Esentya Protocol

The D. Esentya Protocol uses a **Tiered DAO Model** based on symbolic worth, commitment, and presence. Each DAO is more than a governance entity — it is a living manifestation of karma, service, and lineage.

---

## 🧬 Principles

- All DAOs begin from an Esentya ID.
- DAO creation is a **symbolic ritual**: it requires presence, stake, and intention.
- The **Tier** determines the power, depth, visibility, and responsibilities of the DAO.
- Higher Tiers = Higher symbolic accountability = Higher $D.Wth required.

---

## 🪷 Creation Requirements

To create any DAO:

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Minimum of **3 unique Esentya IDs**
- 🎖 Stake of **$DFlow and/or $D.Wth**, depending on Tier
- 🧾 A chosen **DAO name**, cycle, and intent
- 🧬 Optional lineage link to a parent DAO

## 🔺 Tier Levels (Summary Table)

| Tier     | Stake Type            | Symbolic Meaning       | Permissions Unlocked                        |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 0.0001   | Only $DFlow            | Seed of presence       | Local registry, no karma visibility         |
| 0.1      | $DFlow + validation    | Initial karma access   | Can mint Service NFTs                       |
| 1        | + minimal $D.Wth       | Recognition            | Can validate IDs + assign missions          |
| 10       | $DFlow + $D.Wth        | Community scope        | Can issue TruthGrants                       |
| 33       | $D.Wth + LightPod link | Regional field         | Can run LightPods (PoW presence validators) |
| 50       | $D.Wth only            | DAO of DAOs            | Spawn sub-DAOs, run marketplaces            |
| 100      | Symbolic appointment   | Origin (Madhava)       | Supreme DAO: anchors the entire lineage     |

## 🔐 DAO Tiers in Detail

### 🪴 Tier 0.0001 → 0.1 — Local & Personal DAOs

- Entry point for individuals or symbolic projects
- Operate locally or thematically
- Low stake → high accessibility
- Limited power: can't assign karma or mint grants

---

### 🔥 Tier 1 → 10 — Validating DAOs

- Gain access to RedPill functions
- Can co-sign ID mints and missions
- Can propose missions to the Esentya network
- Operate service-based microeconomies
- Medium stake: mix of $DFlow + earned $D.Wth

---

### 🛡 Tier 33 → Regional DAOs

- Can operate a **LightPod Node** (geographical validator)
- Validate physical presence (BLE/GPS PoEs)
- Moderate-to-high symbolic responsibility
- May initiate **Proof-of-Worth** reward cycles

---

### 🌀 Tier 50 → Master DAOs

- Can generate other DAOs via symbolic lineage
- Operate a DAO-specific **Marketplace**
- Require significant $D.Wth stake
- Governance roles in protocol-wide votes
- May receive recurring symbolic yield from protocol

---

### 👁 Tier 100 — Supreme DAO (D. Esentya Origin)

- Can only be minted by **Madhava** via offering
- Anchors the Esentya network at its core
- Responsible for:
  - Updating the Oracle Dharma
  - Hosting initial Genesis DAO
  - Activating the first Karma Cycle

---

## 🌱 Evolving Tiers

DAOs can **evolve tiers over time** by:

- Increasing their $D.Wth stake
- Validating members and completing cycles
- Being recognized by other DAOs through TruthGrants
- Hosting rituals and contributing to the ecosystem

---

## 🧭 On DAO Lineage

Each DAO can:
- Declare a **lineage parent**
- Pass on its symbolic essence to child DAOs
- Create a **chain of worth and karma** in metadata

> "From One, Many.  
> From Dream, DAO."

---

## 🛠 Technical Implementation (Planned)

DAOs will be instantiated via:

- CosmWasm-based DAO DAO contracts (forked)
- Tier logic enforced via custom staking modules
- On-chain metadata (origin, tier, cycle, parent)
- Multisig or single-signer based on configuration

---

## 🧩 Open Invitation

We invite builders to co-create the DAO Tier mechanics:

- What privileges should each Tier have?
- How should karma be distributed?
- What symbolic roles must be minted?
