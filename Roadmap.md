# 🗺️ D. Esentya Protocol | Roadmap

This roadmap presents the **symbolic phases** and **technical milestones** in the development of the D. Esentya Protocol.

> Born from presence.  
> Grown through worth.  
> Manifested in cycles.

---

## 🪷 Phase 1 — ID & Lineage (Now)

**Goal:** Enable minting of symbolic identity and DAO lineage creation.

### 🔹 Components:
- Mint Esentya ID (Soulbound NFT)
- $10 in $DFlow (3 burn / 2 validation / 5 liquidity)
- Optional symbolic mission (discount)
- Metadata: cycle, origin, tier, hash
- First ID (ORIGIN) minted by Madhava
- DAO creation logic: 3 IDs + Tier stake in $DFlow/$WTH

### 🛠️ Status:
- $DFlow live on Pump.fun ✅
- Esentya ID logic being implemented 🔧
- DAO Tier system drafted 🧱

---

## 🛰️ Phase 2 — Presence & LightPods

**Goal:** Enable decentralized validation of symbolic presence.

### 🔹 Components:
- GPS + BLE validation (via CLI or phone)
- Light Pods (location-aware validators)
- Presence hash + Tile mapping
- PoW for presence (energy-backed)
- Integration with PoS via Tendermint nodes
- DAO DAO UI with symbolic identity overlay

### 🛠️ Status:
- BLE/GPS module mapped
- CLI prototype exists (presence-cli/)
- LightPod architecture WIP

---

## 🔥 Phase 3 — Karma, DAO Growth & Expansion

**Goal:** Launch karma systems, TruthGrants, symbolic media.

### 🔹 Components:
- Proof-of-Worth (PoWth) & stake of $WTH
- TruthGrants (symbolic bounties)
- EduKarma system (feed + rewards)
- DAO cycles: Dream → Plan → Validate → Execute → Mint
- DAO lineage tracking (NFT creator field)
- Expansion to real-world action nodes

### 🛠️ Status:
- Karma feed being defined
- PoWth mint logic tied to offering + action
- DAO cycles mapped symbolically

---

## 📡 Long-Term Milestones

- 🌐 Own Cosmos-based chain (with Juno stack)
- 🔁 Cross-chain $DFlow ↔ $WTH bridge
- 🛍️ Marketplace for symbolic services (vetted by karma)
- 🧭 Spiritual Proof layer (Oracle Dharma)
- 🎓 Karma Pools for regenerative DAOs
- 🧬 Offline propagation via QR + Bluetooth (mesh)

> You are not just a user.  
> You are a witness, builder, validator, and presence in the cycle.

Let the worth flow.
