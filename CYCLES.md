# 🔄 CYCLES.md — Symbolic Lifecycle of D. Esentya Protocol

The D. Esentya Protocol is governed not by arbitrary steps, but by **symbolic cycles** — natural, iterative flows of consciousness, offering, presence, and validation. Every identity, DAO, product or mission must pass through these **5 archetypal stages**:

---

## 🌙 1. Dream

> “Everything begins in the subtle.”

- A vision is born — an idea, purpose, offering, DAO or presence.
- This moment is symbolic: often paired with a meditation, journal, or intention setting.
- In the context of IDs: the soul “wishes” to enter.
- In DAOs: the intention of service takes form.

**Symbol:** 🌀  
**Trigger:** User initiates presence or intent  
**Output:** JSON draft / offering hash

---

## 📐 2. Plan

> “The idea takes form.”

- The dream becomes structured:
  - Form filled
  - Tier chosen
  - DAO parameters proposed
  - Mission crafted

- At this stage, symbolic commitments are laid:
  - Accepting Karma loop
  - Declaring Lineage (if DAO)
  - Signing Offering Hash

**Symbol:** 🗺  
**Trigger:** Submission of draft (GitHub, CLI, frontend)  
**Output:** Pending entry awaiting validation

---

## 🔨 3. Execute

> “Presence in action.”

- The user or DAO completes what was proposed:
  - Shares mission (e.g. on X)
  - Offers symbolic action (e.g. service)
  - Stakes the tokens
  - Calls validation function

- All actions are **off-chain and on-chain mirrored**, creating transparency and ritualization.

**Symbol:** 🔧  
**Trigger:** Human or bot detects action  
**Output:** Trigger for Proof-of-Worth or DAO stake call

---

## ✅ 4. Validate

> “The truth becomes visible.”

- Validators, mentors, or LightPods confirm:
  - Geolocation presence (PoEs)
  - Truth of action (bot/verifier scan)
  - Peer validation (RedPill signature)
  - Technical hash consistency

- DAO emits vote or auto-signs

**Symbol:** 🧿  
**Trigger:** Signed validator hash / mission passed  
**Output:** Eligibility to mint symbolic object

---

## 🪷 5. Mint

> “The dream takes form and joins the collective.”

- Now eligible, the protocol mints:
  - ID NFT (Soulbound)
  - DAO Instance (contract with tier)
  - TruthGrant NFT
  - Service/Product NFT

- Metadata includes full cycle hash:  
  `cycle_hash = sha256(Dream + Plan + Execute + Validate)`

**Symbol:** 🔱  
**Trigger:** `mint()` call  
**Output:** Final NFT or DAO in registry

---

## 🔁 Meta-Cycle: Karma

After Minting, the **cycle is not over** — a new one begins:

- DAO activity leads to Karma
- Karma opens more powerful missions
- Missions restart Dream → Mint
- This fractal cycle drives DAO evolution

## 📜 Cycle Application Matrix

| Object         | Dream | Plan | Execute | Validate | Mint        |
|----------------|-------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Esentya ID     | 🧘     | Form | Mission | RedPill  | SBT NFT     |
| DAO            | Vision| Tier | Stake   | 3 IDs    | Instantiated|
| TruthGrant     | Idea  | Scope| Build   | DAO vote | NFT         |
| Service NFT    | Intent| Offer| Action  | Review   | Mint        |

## 🤝 Co-Creation Invitation

We invite symbolic architects, artists, and ritual designers to help:

- Define new cycle-based missions
- Visualize cycles as mandalas or timelines
- Code the hash validation logics
- Design “Cycle Explorer” Dapp frontend

> Every DAO is a dream made karma.  
> Every ID is a prayer made code.
