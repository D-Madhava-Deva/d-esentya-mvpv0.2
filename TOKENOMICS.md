# 💠 TOKENOMICS.md – D. Esentya Protocol

This document outlines the dual-token economic model powering the D. Esentya Protocol, built upon symbolic reputation, regenerative value, and purposeful interaction.

## 🔁 Dual Token System

| Token     | Symbol   | Chain    | Type         | Nature     | Purpose                          |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Flow      | $DFlow   | Solana   | SPL          | Fungible   | Utility, liquidity, fuel         |
| Worth     | $D.Wth   | Cosmos   | CW20 (SBT)   | Soulbound  | Reputation, karma, governance    |

---

## 💠 $DFlow – Energy & Utility

- Minted on Solana, launched via [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun/36kiWhP1pxwRQ2fUwJj2SiTfopJhFTuBtHFWLjsKVps3)
- Used for:
  - Minting symbolic Esentya ID NFTs
  - Paying fees to validators and bots
  - Fueling DAO creation alongside $D.Wth
  - Forming LPs in decentralized liquidity pools
- Partial burn at every symbolic action
- Bridgeable to Cosmos (future): Flow ↔ Purpose bridge

---

## 🎖️ $D.Wth – Reputation & Worth

- Minted on Cosmos (CW20)
- Soulbound: cannot be transferred
- Earned via:
  - Completing symbolic missions
  - Proof-of-Presence (GPS/BLE, LightPods)
  - DAO mentoring or validation
  - Participating in TruthGrants
- Represents access, trust, karma, and spiritual score
- Required to create DAOs and ascend Tiers

---

## 🧱 DAO Tiers

Your **DAO Tier** defines what kind of symbolic work you can do and how trusted your presence is in the protocol.

| Tier       | Stake Type         | Example Use                          |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Tier 0.0001 | $DFlow only         | Minimal DAO, basic symbolic presence |
| Tier 10     | $DFlow + some $D.Wth| Local mission DAO                    |
| Tier 50     | Significant $D.Wth | Regional DAO with TruthGrant power   |
| Tier 100    | $D.Wth + Karma      | Global DAO validator, Guardian level|

- DAOs require **3 unique Esentya IDs** + Tier stake
- Only the **origin DAO** (by Madhava) can mint Tier 100

---

## 🛍️ Products, Services & Symbolic Marketplace

All services, offerings and TruthGrants are:

- Minted as NFTs (Soulbound or Liquid)
- Require DAO-level approval
- Paid in $DFlow, gated by $D.Wth + karma
- Published in the Marketplace (planned module)

Example:
- Offer a “Service of Listening” NFT
- DAO validates → Receives karma badge
- Buyer uses $DFlow → DAO treasury receives fee
- Performer earns $D.Wth if well-rated

## 🔁 Token Flow Summary

| Action                  | Cost              | Output                        |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Mint ID                 | $10 in $DFlow     | Soulbound NFT + metadata      |
| Skip symbolic mission   | +$5               | No $D.Wth earned              |
| Complete mission        | Free              | Discount + $D.Wth unlocked    |
| Stake for DAO           | $DFlow + $D.Wth   | DAO creation (based on Tier)  |
| Sell a service          | LP required       | Treasury + karma split        |
| Earn reputation         | via PoWth         | Mint $D.Wth                   |

---

## ♻️ Economic Sustainability

- 30% of $DFlow burned at mint
- 20% paid to validator bots / LightPods
- 50% added to LP → DAO Treasury
- Karma score determines rewards over time
- DAO redistributes symbolic yield via TruthGrants

---

## 🌉 Solana ↔ Cosmos Bridge (Planned)

$DFlow will be bridged using:
- Wormhole or Hyperlane
- Indexed swap into symbolic worth (burn + claim logic)
- No direct $DFlow → $D.Wth conversion — only via merit

---
